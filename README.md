# JoansStuff
Here is generally where any code I write that is NOT homework will go.
WARNING: a lot of code here may not have comments whoops

# Classes

## TestChoices
A Java program that  tests whether one should pick random answers or stick
with one answer while guessing on a test

## PrimeGen
A Python program that has several functions that generate primes either
indefinitely or to a maximum value. It also uses matplotlib to graph how long
it takes to generate these numbers

## MySortsPlus
A version of MySorts that I did in APCS class, but including a couple other
interesting sorts.

## JoanCipher
A encryption/decryption program that utilizes a caesar-cipher-like mechanism
to shift letters. However, the key shifts letters in such a way that
encrypting "llll" generally will not result in a String of 4 of the same
character (like "aaaa"; it will return something like "suhn")

## Blackjack
The simple, yet fun game of Blackjack! Player vs. Computer. Multiplayer
(hopefully) coming soon!
